# ZTOS (Zero Trust Operating System)

**ZTOS** is a secure, scalable, and flexible operating system designed to implement **Zero Trust Networking** principles. It is deployable across cloud environments like **AWS**, hybrid infrastructures like **Equinix Metal**, and private on-premises hardware. ZTOS ensures multi-layer encryption, dynamic routing, and secure containerized network services for industries like Aerospace, Defense, Finance, and Government.

## Key Features

- **iPXE Booting**: Zero-touch deployment into cloud or bare-metal environments.
- **Custom Linux Distribution**: Networking-focused OS, potentially based on VyOS, optimized for routing and security services.
- **Multi-Layer Encryption**: Layer 2 encryption with **MACsec** and Layer 3 encryption with **WireGuard**.
- **Containerized Network Services**: Modular and scalable services such as **BGP**, **WireGuard**, and **MACsec**.
- **Zero Trust Networking**: Continuous authentication and least-privilege access to all network resources.
- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Fully isolated VRFs and VXLANs for traffic segmentation.

## Project Status

ZTOS is currently under active development. The repository includes the initial architecture design, boot process configurations, and containerized network services.

## Installation and Usage
