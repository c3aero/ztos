# ZTOS (Zero Trust Operating System)

**ZTOS** is a secure, scalable, and flexible operating system designed to implement **Zero Trust Networking** principles. It is deployable across cloud environments like **AWS**, hybrid infrastructures like **Equinix Metal**, and private on-premises hardware. ZTOS ensures multi-layer encryption, dynamic routing, and secure containerized network services for industries like Aerospace, Defense, Finance, and Government.

## Key Features

- **iPXE Booting**: Zero-touch deployment into cloud or bare-metal environments.
- **Custom Linux Distribution**: Networking-focused OS, optimized for routing and security services.
- **Multi-Layer Encryption**: Layer 2 encryption with **MACsec** and Layer 3 encryption with **WireGuard**.
- **Containerized Network Services**: Modular and scalable services such as **BGP**, **WireGuard**, and **MACsec**.
- **Zero Trust Networking**: Continuous authentication and least-privilege access to all network resources.
- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Fully isolated VRFs and VXLANs for traffic segmentation.

## Project Status

ZTOS is currently under active development. The repository includes the initial architecture design, boot process configurations, and containerized network services.

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

- **iPXE** for network booting
- **Docker** or **Podman** for containerized services
- Access to **AWS**, **Equinix Metal**, or on-prem hardware

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

	```bash
   git clone https://github.com/c3aero/ztos.git
   cd ztos

2. Build the ZTOS kernel:

   Follow the instructions in **`docs/build-instructions.md`** to build the ZTOS kernel, create the initrd, and prepare the system for deployment.

3. Boot into ZTOS:

   Use iPXE to boot into ZTOS in your desired environment. Detailed instructions are available in **`docs/ipxe-boot-guide.md`** for AWS, Equinix Metal, and on-prem hardware.

4. Set up Network Services:

   Once ZTOS is booted, use Docker or Podman to run containerized services such as **BGP**, **WireGuard**, and **MACsec**. See **`docs/container-setup.md`** for more details on how to set up and run these services.
