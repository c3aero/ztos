## **ZTOS Architecture Overview**

**ZTOS (Zero Trust Operating System)** is a highly secure, scalable, and flexible operating system built to implement **Zero Trust Networking** principles. ZTOS is designed to provide robust **multi-tenant support**, **layered encryption**, **dynamic routing**, and **cloud-native orchestration** for modern network infrastructures. It is deployable across cloud environments such as **AWS**, hybrid infrastructures like **Equinix Metal**, and private **on-premises hardware**.

### **Key Features of ZTOS**
1. **iPXE Booting**: ZTOS can be booted dynamically into cloud environments or bare-metal hardware using **iPXE**, allowing for zero-touch provisioning.
2. **Custom Linux Distro**: Based on a custom Linux distribution (such as VyOS or an alternative) to provide full **routing**, **containerization**, and **security services**.
3. **Multi-Layer Encryption**: Traffic is secured using **WireGuard (Layer 3)** and **MACsec (Layer 2)** encryption, ensuring privacy and security even within shared infrastructure.
4. **Containerized Network Services**: Core network functionalities, such as routing, encryption, and traffic management, are containerized for scalability and modularity.
5. **Zero Trust Model**: Enforces Zero Trust principles by requiring continuous authentication and providing end-to-end encryption across the entire network.

### **Core Components**

#### **1. iPXE Booting and Dynamic Deployment**
ZTOS is bootable via **iPXE**, which allows it to be deployed dynamically across multiple platforms without manual installation. Using iPXE, the ZTOS system can:
- **Boot into AWS**: ZTOS can be provisioned on AWS EC2 instances with cloud-native networking and integration (VPC, Direct Connect).
- **Boot into Equinix Metal**: Allows provisioning on bare-metal infrastructure for maximum performance and security.
- **Boot into On-Prem Hardware**: ZTOS can be booted into private data centers or edge locations for localized network control.

#### **How iPXE Works**:
1. The iPXE script initiates the boot process, loading the **ZTOS kernel** and **initrd**.
2. Based on the environment (cloud, hybrid, or on-prem), the iPXE script dynamically configures networking, storage, and other parameters to bring up the system.
3. ZTOS is initialized with predefined **networking policies**, containerized services, and routing configurations.

#### **2. Custom Linux Distribution**
ZTOS is built on top of a **custom Linux distribution** (potentially based on VyOS or another networking-focused OS) that is optimized for:
- **Full Network Stack Support**: Including **BGP**, **EVPN**, **VRF**, **VXLAN**, and **QoS**.
- **Container Orchestration**: Supporting **Docker** or **Podman** containers for isolating and scaling network services.
- **Security Services**: Enabling **MACsec**, **WireGuard**, and **firewall functionality** at the kernel level.

The custom Linux distro provides:
- **Dynamic routing capabilities**.
- **Maximum network performance** for multi-tenant environments.
- **Container-based microservices** for networking and security functions.

#### **3. Multi-Layer Encryption**
ZTOS implements two layers of encryption to ensure **end-to-end security** for all network traffic:
1. **WireGuard (Layer 3)**: Provides encryption at the network layer for all traffic traveling between **spine** and **leaf nodes**. WireGuard is responsible for securing the communication over the underlay, ensuring that any intercepted traffic remains protected.
2. **MACsec (Layer 2)**: Provides encryption at the data link layer, securing **VXLAN** encapsulated traffic within the overlay. This ensures that even within the same tenant’s VXLAN, sensitive data remains encrypted and is only accessible to authorized devices.

By separating encryption responsibilities, **WireGuard** ensures secure transport over the infrastructure, while **MACsec** secures the payload between **leaf nodes**, ensuring that the **spine** cannot decrypt customer data.

---

#### **4. Containerized Network Services**
ZTOS relies on **containerization** to deliver flexible, modular, and scalable network services. Key services include:
- **Routing and Switching**: **BGP**, **EVPN**, and **VRF** routing services are deployed as containers, allowing for independent updates and scaling.
- **Encryption Services**: Both **WireGuard** and **MACsec** run as containers, ensuring encryption services can be managed and orchestrated independently of the base OS.
- **Monitoring and Observability**: Tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana** are deployed as containers, providing real-time insights into network performance, encryption status, and tenant traffic flows.

---

#### **5. Zero Trust Networking**
ZTOS fully embraces the **Zero Trust security model**, ensuring that no part of the network is trusted by default. Every entity, device, and service must authenticate before gaining access to resources. Key principles include:
- **Continuous Authentication**: Enforcing continuous verification of user and device identity across the network.
- **Least Privilege Access**: Users and services only have access to the specific network resources required for their roles.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All traffic within ZTOS is encrypted, ensuring that even if intercepted, no sensitive information is exposed.

#### **Layered Security Model**:
- **MACsec for Layer 2**: Ensures all Layer 2 traffic within the VXLAN overlay is fully encrypted, protecting against internal threats.
- **WireGuard for Layer 3**: Provides additional security for traffic over the network infrastructure, securing the Layer 3 transport layer.

### **ZTOS Networking Architecture**

#### **1. BGP/EVPN for Routing and Tenant Isolation**
ZTOS utilizes **BGP** and **EVPN** to manage dynamic routing across tenants, ensuring proper isolation and scalability:
- **BGP** handles routing between the spine and leaf nodes, ensuring that traffic is dynamically routed based on **VNI mappings**.
- **EVPN** extends **Layer 2 domains** over Layer 3, enabling tenant-specific VXLAN tunnels that ensure proper segmentation across the network.

#### **2. VXLAN for Layer 2 Encapsulation**
**VXLAN** is used to encapsulate **Layer 2 traffic** over the **Layer 3 underlay**. Each tenant is assigned its own **VNI (VXLAN Network Identifier)**, ensuring that:
- Tenant traffic is fully isolated within its VXLAN tunnel.
- The **spine** handles VXLAN routing and switching, while the **MACsec-encrypted payload** remains secure.

#### **3. VRFs for Network Segmentation**
Each tenant in ZTOS has its own **VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding table)**, ensuring complete isolation of routing tables across different tenants or customers. The spine maps **VNIs to VRFs**, ensuring that no tenant can access another tenant’s traffic.

#### **4. QoS for Traffic Management**
ZTOS allows for **QoS policies** to be applied dynamically at both the **Layer 2 (VXLAN)** and **Layer 3 (WireGuard)** levels. These policies ensure that critical services (e.g., voice, video) are prioritized across the network, while less critical services are rate-limited.

### **Deployment and Scaling**

#### **1. Cloud Deployment (AWS Integration)**
ZTOS integrates natively with **AWS**:
- **iPXE Booting**: ZTOS instances can be dynamically booted into AWS EC2, with network services automatically configured for **VPC peering**, **Direct Connect**, and **AWS Transit Gateway**.
- **Container Orchestration**: ZTOS leverages **ECS** or **EKS** for managing containerized network services in a cloud-native manner.

#### **2. Bare Metal Deployment (Equinix Metal Integration)**
When deployed on **Equinix Metal**, ZTOS runs on bare-metal servers, providing maximum performance:
- **Equinix Fabric Integration**: Leverage **Equinix’s private interconnection services** to provide low-latency, high-performance connections across regions and data centers.
- **ZTOS Scaling**: ZTOS can scale horizontally across multiple Equinix regions using **private links** and **BGP peering**.

#### **3. On-Prem Deployment (Private Metal)**
ZTOS can be booted into **private on-prem hardware** via iPXE, creating a fully private **Zero Trust infrastructure** within your data center or edge locations. On-prem deployment allows for:
- Full control over networking, storage, and compute resources.
- Integration with **ZTOS orchestration tools** for dynamic provisioning of network services.

### **Future Vision: ZTOS as an OS**

**ZTOS** is designed to evolve into a **full-fledged operating system** that can:
- **Boot via iPXE** on demand into any infrastructure (cloud, hybrid, or on-prem).
- **Run a custom Linux distribution** that is fully optimized for containerized networking.
- **Support Zero Trust networking** at all layers of the OS, ensuring end-to-end encryption, segmentation, and dynamic routing.
- **Expand into new technologies**, such as **edge computing**, **5G networking**, and **IoT security**.
