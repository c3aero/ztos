### **ZTOS Architecture Overview**

The **Zero Trust Overlay System (ZTOS)** is a highly modular and containerized networking and security architecture designed to implement **zero-trust security principles** in a scalable, decentralized manner. ZTOS serves industries such as **aerospace**, **finance**, **healthcare**, and **government**, providing a secure and adaptable solution for network management, identity management, and service orchestration. Below is a comprehensive high-level overview of ZTOS, encompassing its various components and how they function cohesively.

#### **1. Core Principles and Design Philosophy**

ZTOS is built upon the **zero-trust security model**, which emphasizes **continuous verification** of identity and security posture for all network transactions. The system operates on the following core principles:

- **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Every entity within ZTOS—whether users, devices, or services—is authenticated continuously.
- **Least Privilege Access**: Access is granted on a need-to-know basis, ensuring that entities are only given the permissions required for their specific tasks.
- **Decentralized and Highly Available**: The architecture avoids centralized orchestration servers and focuses on decentralized control, aiming to achieve the resilience and reliability of critical systems.
- **IPv6 Native**: ZTOS leverages an IPv6-native underlay network, with support for IPv4 via NAT64, ensuring scalability and modern protocol adoption.

#### **2. High-Level Components of ZTOS**

ZTOS consists of several key components that work together to provide a **secure network overlay**, including **identity management**, **routing**, **multicast support**, **encryption**, and **automated deployment**. Below is an overview of the core components:

##### **2.1 Modular Containerized Architecture**

- **Containers for Each Network Function**: ZTOS uses a fully containerized approach, with each network function—such as **routing**, **firewall**, **access control**, **encryption**, and **service discovery**—implemented as individual containers. This modular design provides **flexibility**, **portability**, and **scalability**.
- **Service Containers**: Key components like **BIND DNS** for service discovery, **OpenLDAP** for identity management and configuration storage, and **FRR** for BGP routing run as containers to ensure they can be independently scaled, managed, and updated.

##### **2.2 Identity and Access Management with LDAP**

- **LDAP as the Identity Authority**: **OpenLDAP** serves as the core identity management solution, storing information about users, devices, roles, access policies, and certificates. Each **ZTOS node** and service is registered in **LDAP**, making it easy to manage identities consistently.
- **LDAP for Configuration Management**: In addition to identity management, **LDAP** is used for storing **network configurations**, such as service endpoints, real-time network state, and VNI mappings. By using LDAP as a single source of truth for both identity and configuration, ZTOS ensures consistency and simplifies management across the network.
- **RBAC and ABAC Enforcement**: **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** and **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)** are implemented using LDAP attributes, enabling dynamic policy enforcement. Attributes such as **device health**, **user role**, and **location** are continuously queried to determine access permissions.
- **Certificate Management and PKI Integration**: **LDAP** integrates with **PKI** to manage public keys, certificates, and key rotation schedules, ensuring all communications within ZTOS are authenticated and encrypted.

##### **2.3 Routing and Multicast Support**

- **BGP and EVPN for Overlay Routing**: ZTOS uses **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)** with **EVPN (Ethernet VPN)** to create an overlay network that allows for efficient and scalable routing of traffic. **FRRouting (FRR)** is used as the routing stack, supporting the advertisement of prefixes, route convergence, and multi-homing capabilities.
- **VXLAN for Layer 2 Overlays**: **VXLAN** (Virtual Extensible LAN) is used to extend Layer 2 domains over Layer 3 infrastructure, allowing for **network virtualization**. **VTEP (VXLAN Tunnel Endpoint)** configurations are used to establish the overlay, while multicast capabilities allow efficient communication between VTEPs.
